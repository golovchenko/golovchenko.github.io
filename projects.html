<p> I have been studying the “hacktivist” Anonymous movement since 2012. My interested is driven by the desire to understand new forms of global, decentralized collective action.  </p>

<p>  How can ethnically, religiously distinct individuals in each their own part of the globe unite in a shared cause without ever meeting offline? How can intense feelings of solidarity come forth in virtual chat-forums and faceless skype calls? I elaborate on these topics in my qualitative bachelor thesis (2012) which is available in Danish <a href="http://www.braintrustbase.com/publikation/anonymous-bev%C3%A6gelsen">here</a>. </p>

<p> Currently I am researching how the state-of-the-art technology can answer previously unanswered questions. In my latest project I use Facebook data and social network analysis to illustrate the vastness and global interconnectivity of the movement. The graph below is an extract that illustrates Facebook pages affiliated with the movement and their connections through likes.  </p>

<h3>Conflict between Russia and Ukraine </h3>
<hr>

<p> I am currently writing my master’s thesis about the flux of information in the conflict in Ukraine. The fact that Russia annexed Crime during few weeks with no major exchange of fire illustrates the significance of so called “information warfare” in the 21st century. The purpose of this project is to make sense of the chaotic streams of contradiction information, misinformation, propaganda and “trolling” with the help of “big data” and digital methods. This involves datamining from Twitter, Youtube, Facebook and the Russian social media site, Vkontakte. Having personal background from both Crimea and Kiev I will explore the virtual conflict as it takes place in both Russian and Ukrainian.  </p>

<h3> Affiliations amongst Danish politicians in educational institutions </h3>
<hr>

<p>The purpose of an educational institution is to shape the worldview of the students through knowledge. Different institutions offer different knowledge, experiences, personal relations and therefore different perspective on the world. In the context of modern national states, politicians shape the world we live in through laws. However, it is often forgotten that politicians too have a life history which affects both their views and behavior.  In order to understand the political processes we therefore need to examine political lives from a sociological perspective. I suggest that this can be done by mapping the politician’s educational background through social network analysis.  </p>

<p>In my study of the Danish case I show that not only do 40 out of 179 Members of Parliament have a background in Political science, but a large proportion of them have been enrolled at the same department during the same time span. </p>

<p>The graph below show a selected network of MP’s that studies Political Science at Copenhagen University. The color shows party affiliation while line thickness represents amount of years the politicians have shared together while officially being enrolled (though not necessarily physically co-present). </p>

<h3>Danish Prison Networks </h3>
<hr>

<p>There is little evidence which shows that incarceration makes inmates less criminal. One the contrary, many argue that prisons can be seen as “state funded crime schools”. Given the increasing focus on retribution in Scandinavian societies, it is unlikely that prisons will go away. The important question should therefore be: What happens within prison walls? My argument is that new technologies and Social Network Analysis can offer a new, detailed insight into this very topic. I have initiated a research project in 2015 in collaboration with public institutions in an attempt to make important knowledge publically available. The findings from ongoing research will be uploaded here when complete.</p>



<h3>Business Hack 2015</h3>
<hr>

<p>I my team and I won the first prize at the Business Hack case competition at the Technical University of Denmark. During two day long hackathon we found a method to evaluate companies based on their centrality in the social network of companies. The approach is based on official, publicly available data about all registered companies in Denmark. Further information in Danish can be found <a href="https://businesshack2015.wordpress.com/2015/10/12/gruppe-8/">here</a>.  </p>
