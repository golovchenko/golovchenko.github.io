Trump received the endorsement of Alabama Senator Jeff Sessions. Senator Sessions is widely recognized as the nation s most highly respected official on the issue of illegal immigration.   Mr. Trump stated  \u201cI am deeply honored to have the endorsement of Senator Jeff Sessions  leader of congressional conservatives. He has been called the Senate s indispensable man and the gold standard. He led the fight against the Gang of Eight  against Obama s trade deal  against Obama s judges  and for American sovereignty. He has stood up to special interests as few have. There is no more respected man in Congress and we are closely aligned on many issues  including trade and illegal immigration  and I am proud to consider Jeff Sessions an advisor  friend and ally.\u201d   Mr. Trump and Senator Sessions surprised the massive crowd at the frontrunner\u2019s Alabama rally just days before Super Tuesday Primary contest.   Senator Sessions added  \u201cI am thrilled today to offer my endorsement of Donald J. Trump for President. This election is our last chance to save U.S. sovereignty and to end the domination of the political establishment over the interests of working Americans. Trump alone has rejected the donor class  defending America\u2019s jobs and wages from open borders  uncontrolled immigration and the massive Trans-Pacific Partnership that will cede U.S. authority to foreign powers. Trump\u2019s trade and immigration plans will revitalize our shrinking middle class  keeping jobs and wealth and income inside the United States of America. Trump understands that a nation must always place the interests of its own people first.\u201d   Senator Sessions continued  \u201cWe are nearing fast the point of no return. The people are hurting. Their wages are declining. Their schools are overburdened. Their hospitals are stretched past the breaking point. Crime is up  and community confidence is down. Americans of all backgrounds and ethnicities  immigrant and US-born  are crying out for leadership that puts their needs first  that takes care of those living and dreaming here today  leadership that understands that there is no constituency other than the American constituency. Mr. Trump is that leader.   We are witnessing an incredible movement  arising from the people.   The events of history have aligned to give the people this fleeting chance to bust up the oligarchy \u2013 to take back control from the \u2018Masters of the Universe\u2019 return it to the good and decent and patriotic citizens of the United States.\u201d","source":"Donald Trump","post_published":"2016-02-28T23:58:05+0000","reactions_count_fb":76217,"likes_count_fb":72786,"comments_count_fb":7113,"shares_count_fb":6669,"Topic 1":0.0380534670265439,"Topic 2":0.427234697538476,"Topic 3":0.0884178540134148,"Topic 4":0.0658287795765057,"Topic 5":0.0757188321721438,"Topic 6":0.165446792137475,"Topic 7":0.0114582948130997,"Topic 8":0.0838880515804249,"Topic 9":0.038773909151327,"Topic 10":0.00517932199058905},{"id":456,"body":"There are a lot of bullies in this world.

I hope that he will be a successful president for all Americans.  This is not the outcome we wanted or we worked so hard for  and I\u2019m sorry we did not win this election for the values we share and the vision we hold for our country.  But I feel pride and gratitude for this wonderful campaign that we built together\u2014this vast  diverse  creative  unruly  energized campaign. You represent the best of America  and being your candidate has been one of the greatest honors of my life.  I know how disappointed you feel  because I feel it too. And so do tens of millions of Americans who invested their hopes and dreams in this effort. This is painful  and it will be for a long time. But I want you to remember this: Our campaign was never about one person or even one election. It was about the country we love\u2014and about building an America that\u2019s hopeful  inclusive  and big-hearted.  We have seen that our nation is more deeply divided than we thought. But I still believe in America\u2014and I always will. And if you do  too  then we must accept this result\u2014and then look to the future.  Donald Trump is going to be our president. We owe him an open mind and the chance to lead.  Our constitutional democracy enshrines the peaceful transfer of power  and we don\u2019t just respect that  we cherish it. It also enshrines other things\u2014the rule of law  the principle that we\u2019re all equal in rights and dignity  and the freedom of worship and expression. We respect and cherish these things too\u2014and we must defend them.  And let me add: Our constitutional democracy demands our participation  not just every four years  but all the time. So let\u2019s do all we can to keep advancing the causes and values we all hold dear: making our economy work for everyone  not just those at the top; protecting our country and protecting our planet; and breaking down all the barriers that hold anyone back from achieving their dreams.  We\u2019ve spent a year and a half bringing together millions of people from every corner of our country to say with one voice that we believe that the American Dream is big enough for everyone\u2014for people of all races and religions  for men and women  for immigrants  for LGBT people  and people with disabilities. Our responsibility as citizens is to keep doing our part to build that better  stronger  fairer America we seek. And I know you will. I am so grateful to stand with all of you.  I want to thank Tim Kaine and Anne Holton for being our partners on this journey. It gives me great hope and comfort to know that Tim will remain on the front-lines of our democracy  representing Virginia in the Senate.  To Barack and Michelle Obama: Our country owes you an enormous debt of gratitude for your graceful  determined leadership  and so do I.  To Bill  Chelsea  Marc  Charlotte  Aidan  our brothers  and our entire family  my love for you means more than I can ever express. You crisscrossed this country on my behalf and lifted me up when I needed it most\u2014even 4-month-old Aidan traveling with his mom.  I will always be grateful to the creative  talented  dedicated men and women at our headquarters in Brooklyn and across our country who poured their hearts into this campaign. For you veterans  this was a campaign after a campaign \u2014 for some of you  this was your first campaign ever. I want each of you to know that you were the best campaign anyone has had.  To all the volunteers  community leaders  activists  and union organizers who knocked on doors  talked to neighbors  posted on Facebook\u2014even in secret or in private: Thank you.  To everyone who sent in contributions as small as $5 and kept us going  thank you.  And to all the young people in particular  I want you to hear this. I\u2019ve spent my entire adult life fighting for what I believe in. I\u2019ve had successes and I\u2019ve had setbacks\u2014sometimes really painful ones. Many of you are at the beginning of your careers. You will have successes and setbacks  too.  This loss hurts. But please  please never stop believing that fighting for what\u2019s right is worth it. It\u2019s always worth it. And we need you keep up these fights now and for the rest of your lives.  To all the women  and especially the young women  who put their faith in this campaign and in me  I want you to know that nothing has made me prouder than to be your champion.  I know that we still have not shattered that highest glass ceiling. But some day someone will\u2014hopefully sooner than we might think right now.  And to all the little girls watching right now  never doubt that you are valuable and powerful and deserving of every chance and opportunity in the world.  Finally  I am grateful to our country for all it has given me. I count my blessings every day that I am an American. And I still believe  as deeply as I ever have  that if we stand together and work together  with respect for our differences  strength in our convictions  and love for this nation\u2014our best days are still ahead of us.  You know I believe we are stronger together and will go forward together. And you should never be sorry that you fought for that. Scripture tells us: \u201cLet us not grow weary in doing good  for in due season  we shall reap  if we do not lose heart.\u201d  My friends  let us have faith in each other. Let us not grow weary. Let us not lose heart. For there are more seasons to come and there is more work to do.  I am incredibly honored and grateful to have had this chance to represent all of you in this consequential election. May God bless you and God bless the United States of America.","source":"Hillary Clinton","post_published":"2016-11-09T18:51:57+0000","reactions_count_fb":1103284,"likes_count_fb":777675,"comments_count_fb":103974,"shares_count_fb":148905,"Topic 1":0.0436344636237542,"Topic 2":0.000851826706866541,"Topic 3":0.88349579384066,"Topic 4":0.00922074311714263,"Topic 5":0.00736720546705879,"Topic 6":0.0016032119315968,"Topic 7":0.00970292411152953,"Topic 8":0.0229250059870767,"Topic 9":0.0120738396720883,"Topic 10":0.00912498554222625},{"id":517,"body":"I\u2019ve said it over and over again.

Last week  a court struck down North Carolina\u2019s voter ID requirement  saying it was designed to \u2018target African Americans with almost surgical precision.\u2019 Similar restrictions have recently been overturned in Wisconsin  Texas  Michigan  North Dakota  and Kansas after courts found they were intended to discriminate as well.   \u201cThis November  the notion that every American has a voice in shaping our future is at stake. Donald Trump supports discriminatory voting restrictions -- and actually claims that without them in place  the results of American elections should be questioned. It\u2019s a dangerous attempt to undermine the legitimacy of our democracy.   \u201cI have a very different view. I believe America is stronger when we expand access to the ballot box  not restrict it. That s why I\u2019ll fight to repair the Voting Rights Act  expand early voting  and introduce universal  automatic voter registration.    \u201cUpon signing the Voting Rights Act in 1965  President Johnson said the right to vote \u2018is one which no American  true to our principles  can deny.\u2019  \u201cHe was right.\u201d  A look back at last year s anniversary:","source":"Hillary Clinton","post_published":"2016-08-06T21:09:24+0000","reactions_count_fb":14573,"likes_count_fb":13041,"comments_count_fb":5056,"shares_count_fb":4273,"Topic 1":0.151478449276031,"Topic 2":0.0057345868872241,"Topic 3":0.323218059192675,"Topic 4":0.0259515462431761,"Topic 5":0.0454022726950364,"Topic 6":0.011293592121419,"Topic 7":0.0531023881847998,"Topic 8":0.0663487524320113,"Topic 9":0.0402907573316699,"Topic 10":0.277179595635957},{"id":728,"body":" We must stand against hate wherever it rears its ugly head.  \u2014Hillary in 2000","source":"Hillary Clinton","post_published":"2016-06-05T22:59:42+0000","reactions_count_fb":17931,"likes_count_fb":16496,"comments_count_fb":3501,"shares_count_fb":1707,"Topic 1":0.452855770311055,"Topic 2":0.00437557582875055,"Topic 3":0.237227856629006,"Topic 4":0.0748986370923463,"Topic 5":0.019009625105996,"Topic 6":0.0163193340413501,"Topic 7":0.0116408584282393,"Topic 8":0.133361144964705,"Topic 9":0.0165363089047513,"Topic 10":0.0337748886938011},{"id":729,"body":"Shooting deaths of police officers up 78% this year.

The concerns have arisen  in particular  with respect to Michigan  Wisconsin and Pennsylvania \u2014 three states that together proved decisive in this presidential election and where the combined margin of victory for Donald Trump was merely 107 000 votes.  It should go without saying that we take these concerns extremely seriously. We certainly understand the heartbreak felt by so many who worked so hard to elect Hillary Clinton  and it is a fundamental principle of our democracy to ensure that every vote is properly counted.  Moreover  this election cycle was unique in the degree of foreign interference witnessed throughout the campaign: the U.S. government concluded that Russian state actors were behind the hacks of the Democratic National Committee and the personal email accounts of Hillary for America campaign officials  and just yesterday  the Washington Post reported that the Russian government was behind much of the \u201cfake news\u201d propaganda that circulated online in the closing weeks of the election.  For all these reasons  we have quietly taken a number of steps in the last two weeks to rule in or out any possibility of outside interference in the vote tally in these critical battleground states. First  since the day after the election we have had lawyers and data scientists and analysts combing over the results to spot anomalies that would suggest a hacked result. These have included analysts both from within the campaign and outside  with backgrounds in politics  technology and academia.  Second  we have had numerous meetings and calls with various outside experts to hear their concerns and to discuss and review their data and findings. As a part of this  we have also shared out data and findings with them. Most of those discussions have remained private  while at least one has unfortunately been the subject of leaks.  Third  we have attempted to systematically catalogue and investigate every theory that has been presented to us within our ability to do so.  Fourth  we have examined the laws and practices as they pertain to recounts  contests and audits.  Fifth  and most importantly  we have monitored and staffed the post-election canvasses \u2014 where voting machine tapes are compared to poll-books  provisional ballots are resolved  and all of the math is double checked from election night. During that process  we have seen Secretary Clinton\u2019s vote total grow  so that  today  her national popular vote lead now exceeds more than 2 million votes.  In the coming days  we will continue to perform our due diligence and actively follow all further activities that are to occur prior to the certification of any election results. For instance  Wisconsin and Pennsylvania conduct post-election audits using a sampling of precincts. Michigan and many other states still do not. This is unfortunate; it is our strong belief that  in addition to an election canvass  every state should do this basic audit to ensure accuracy and public confidence in the election.  Beyond the post-election audit  Green Party candidate Jill Stein announced Friday that she will exercise her right as a candidate to pursue a recount in the state of Wisconsin. She has indicated plans to also seek recounts in Pennsylvania and Michigan.  Because we had not uncovered any actionable evidence of hacking or outside attempts to alter the voting technology  we had not planned to exercise this option ourselves  but now that a recount has been initiated in Wisconsin  we intend to participate in order to ensure the process proceeds in a manner that is fair to all sides. If Jill Stein follows through as she has promised and pursues recounts in Pennsylvania and Michigan  we will take the same approach in those states as well. We do so fully aware that the number of votes separating Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton in the closest of these states \u2014 Michigan \u2014 well exceeds the largest margin ever overcome in a recount. But regardless of the potential to change the outcome in any of the states  we feel it is important  on principle  to ensure our campaign is legally represented in any court proceedings and represented on the ground in order to monitor the recount process itself.  The campaign is grateful to all those who have expended time and effort to investigate various claims of abnormalities and irregularities. While that effort has not  in our view  resulted in evidence of manipulation of results  now that a recount is underway  we believe we have an obligation to the more than 64 million Americans who cast ballots for Hillary Clinton to participate in ongoing proceedings to ensure that an accurate vote count will be reported.
